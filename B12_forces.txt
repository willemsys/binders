Despite the coupling head being flexibly open at the top side it will stay closed when the connection is loaded. This is the main feature of this system.

Changing the sizes is possible but a stable coupling head has to be assured, meaning that the head still has to be flexible and has to stay closed at a growing pulling force when it is connected.
To achieve this the head has to be configurated in a certain way.

The position of four estimated points, found at each of the symmatrical sides, are important, measured with a connected strip inside the head.
The estimation must be made taking the resilience and thickness of the surrounding material into account.

For the purpose of showing these four points an extra plane is placed inside a drawing. Only one side of the coupling head is visible.

The points are the estimated centres of the force between two parts:
Point 1, at the front, is the centre of the pulling force in the front hinge connecting the sidepart and the bottom.
Point 2, the middle top point, is the centre of the pressing force in the hinge connecting the pawl and the sidepart.
Point 3, the middle low point, is the centre of the pressing force in the connecting area of the tip of the pawl and the pushing side of a tooth of the strip.
Point 4, at the top of the back side is the centre of the pulling force in the connection of the pulling part at the back.

Three properties of these points are important:
- The line between points 2 and 4 has to be parallel to the central axe when looking from the top, or point 4 may be a bit more shifted towards the outside.
- The line of the pawl, between 2 and 3 must show an angle of about 25 degrees to the central axe.
- At the crossing point of the line between points 1 and 4 and the line of the pawl, between 2 and 3, the first line must be positioned more near the central axe.
